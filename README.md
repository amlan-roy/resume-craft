### Running the tests

You can run the tests once by using the command `npm run test`
You can also run the tests in watch mode by using the following command `npm run test:watch`

You can test the functionality related to firebase by running the firebase emulator locally (refer [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite))

### env variables

- You can refer the `.env.example` file for the environment variables.
- You will have to get the firebase environment variables from firebase by setting up a firebase project and following the steps mentioned there (refer [this](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592#zippy=%2Cin-this-article)).
- For NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL, you can have `http://localhost:3000` for development and `//$NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL` if you are deploying in vercel.
- COMMAND_1 contains the first command for generating the resumes. Kept it in environment variable so that I can change it without updating the code.
- NOTE: COMMAND_1 and FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY should be stored in the format `{"value":"<the value of the env variable here>"}`
